# Railway-Reservation-System
A basic Railway Reservation System using Concepts of data structures like Linked Lists, Stacks and Queues in C Programming Language.
If the reservation is full, it prompts that the reservation is full and puts the passenger in the waiting list and generates a waiting list number.
If a passenger wishes to cancel his ticket, he may cancel and then the first passenger in waiting list is booked automatically.
